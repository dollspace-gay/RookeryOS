## Linux From Scratch (LFS) Project

EasyLFS is built upon the foundation of the **Linux From Scratch** project, which provides comprehensive instructions for building a Linux system from source code.

### What We Use

This project utilizes the **computer instructions and build commands** from [Linux From Scratch 12.4 (SysVinit)](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.4/), which are licensed under the **MIT License** as stated in the LFS book.

Specifically, we use:
- Build commands and sequences from LFS Chapters 5-10
- Package compilation instructions (configure, make, install)
- System configuration commands
- Kernel build procedures
- Bootloader installation steps

These instructions have been:
- Automated and containerized using Docker
- Organized into modular, sequential services
- Enhanced with checkpointing for idempotent builds
- Wrapped with error handling and logging
- Adapted for reproducible, non-interactive execution

### What We Don't Use

EasyLFS does **not** copy or redistribute the **narrative text, explanations, or editorial content** of the LFS book, which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0.

The LFS book contains extensive educational content explaining:
- Why each step is necessary
- How Linux internals work
- Design decisions and alternatives
- Troubleshooting guidance

**We strongly encourage users to read the original [LFS Book](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.4/)** to understand the concepts and rationale behind each step. The book is an invaluable educational resource.

### Why LFS Matters

The Linux From Scratch project has been teaching people how Linux works since 1999. It provides:
- Deep understanding of Linux internals
- Knowledge of package management and dependencies
- Appreciation for distribution maintainers' work
- Foundation for creating custom Linux distributions

EasyLFS aims to make this educational experience more accessible through automation, while preserving the learning value.

## Educational Context

### Learning Resources

EasyLFS is designed as an **educational tool** to complement the LFS book, not replace it. We recommend:

1. **Start with LFS Book**: Read [LFS 12.4](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/12.4/) to understand concepts
2. **Use EasyLFS for Practice**: Automate the build to focus on understanding rather than manual execution
3. **Experiment**: Modify services to learn how changes affect the build
4. **Compare**: Look at our automation to understand how to script LFS builds

### Related Projects

Other automation approaches for LFS:
- **jhalfs** (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/) - Official LFS automation using XML parsing
- **LFScript** (https://lfscript.org/) - Alternative LFS automation
- **BLFS** (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/) - Beyond Linux From Scratch (additional packages)

Each approach has different goals and trade-offs. EasyLFS focuses on:
- Docker-native architecture
- Educational transparency (readable scripts)
- Modern DevOps practices
- Easy experimentation
